* The router internal clock is 100 MHz for both SpW node clocks and router logic
* External SpW nodes have different clocks (75 MHz or 50 MHz)

Potential issues that might arise:

1. **Data rate mismatches**: If external nodes run slower clocks (50MHz or 75MHz), they'll transmit at slower rates than the router's 100MHz ports. This isn't a problem by itself, as SpaceWire handles asynchronous rates.
2. **Buffer overruns**: If the router is sending at a faster rate than the receiving external node can handle over a sustained period, the receiving node's buffers might eventually fill up. However, SpaceWire's flow control mechanism with FCTs should prevent this in normal operation.
3. **Flow control efficiency**: With large differences in clock speeds, the faster device might spend more time waiting for FCTs from the slower device, reducing overall throughput efficiency.
4. **Jitter and skew tolerance**: Different clock frequencies might lead to different timing margins for jitter and skew tolerance, but as long as the SpaceWire specification is followed, this shouldn't cause operational issues.

* [@r.yin@tu-braunschweig.de](mailto:r.yin@tu-braunschweig.de), VenSpec-M would like to have an asymmetric SpW connection (20 MHz up/40 MHz down). Please check that this will not be a problem for the router.

A: 对于两个SpW Node具有不同时钟频率并没有问题，尤其是在这个spw link 中数据主要从slow SpW node 到 快 SpW node. 

但我们需要对router IP core本身做修改，因为4Links 给我们router IP core 没有为不同的SpW node 设置自己的时钟频率的功能，因此我们需要修改Router IP core的设计来支持以上功能


Regarding your inquiry about implementing an asymmetric SpaceWire connection for VenSpec-M (20 MHz uplink/40 MHz downlink), I can confirm that having different clock frequencies between two SpaceWire nodes is fully supported by the SpaceWire protocol and should not cause any operational issues. This scenario is particularly favorable when data flows predominantly from the slower node to the faster node, as appears to be the case here.

However, I should point out that we will need to make modifications to the router IP core itself. The 4Links router IP core we're currently using does not natively support configuring different clock frequencies for individual SpaceWire nodes. We'll need to modify the Router IP core design to implement this functionality and ensure it properly handles the asymmetric clock rates you've requested.

Our team will begin working on these modifications. Please let me know if you have any specific requirements or if you need any additional information regarding this implementation.
