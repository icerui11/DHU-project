# issue from MPS


* On Thursday Ian tried establish an SPI connection between the pre-EM #1 and a PSU emulator prepared by Alexander Loose, but they were not able to detect any signals on the JC13P connector. Could you please look into the matter and provide instructions on how to proceed?
* Provide updates to the DCL in [https://venspec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PfPssEnvisionCcu/pages/158269445/DHU+DCL](https://venspec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PfPssEnvisionCcu/pages/158269445/DHU+DCL) . The last version is i0.5 from 2024-01-19, but we should update it to reflect the changes to the oscillators (and there might be other updates pending as well).
* Update the block diagram in [https://venspec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PfPssEnvisionCcu/pages/4427428/DHU+Block+Diagram](https://venspec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PfPssEnvisionCcu/pages/4427428/DHU+Block+Diagram) to reflect the fact that the connection to the PSU will be over RS-422 and not LVDS.
* SENER made a suggestion about using a capacitive loading for RS-422: 120 Ohm with 47pF. Would save power, but not a lot. My first inclination would be to stay with the resistive 100 Ohm terminator, but please confirm.
* SENER needs confirmation of min. power, min. voltage, min. current and max current incl. inrush. Please note that DHU should stay below the overcurrent protection level defined at all times including operation mode change and inrush current taking into account a minimum 3.3V voltage line rise time of 2 millisec.
* For the Over-Voltage Protection, SENER is suggesting splitting the requirement in two:
  * First requirement: For normal operation and temporal failures the maximum voltage shall not exceed 3.6V (FPGA).
  * Second requirement: To avoid failure propagation towards the S/C and the channels, over voltage protection with a limit of 4.6V â†’ from SpW driver receiver RHFLVDSR2D2: 4.8 V absolute rating + margin. Please confirm that this approach will be OK with you.
