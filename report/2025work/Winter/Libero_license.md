Can we purchase a Gold license now and later upgrade to a Platinum license by paying the difference once we confirm our RTG4 requirements?

Ans: Yes, you can. When you decide to upgrade to a Platinum license, you will need to request a quote on microchipDIRECT. We will apply the discount, and you can pay the difference.

Note:  If we want to add a seat to a floating license, the cost is the same as the floating license, there are no discount.
